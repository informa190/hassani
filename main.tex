\section{History of mobile games} \label{history mobile games}%\A brief overview of the history of mobile games
The early history of mobile games does not begin with the introduction of the first handheld electronic game in the late 1970s. Although the evolution and improvement in handheld electronic games were seen in this decade, these things did not apply to mobile games.

The era of mobile gaming began in 1994 with the game~\textit{\textbf{Tetris}} on the Hagenuk MT-2000. 3 years later in 1997,~\cite{mayra2015mobile} Nokia introduced one of the most popular mobile games called ~\textit{\textbf{Snake}}, which was pre-installed on Nokia phones. This game, which was on more than 400 million devices worldwide, is also known as the first two-player mobile game in history.

    \item\textbf{It  increases the efficiency of creativity:}When playing mobile games, the player tries to play creatively and control time more.
    \item\textbf{It improves morale and team building:}Weekend breaks are enjoyable for everyone because they are away from the work area and their brains are not busy. Mobile games also allow you to relax and increase the ability to work as a team in important projects.
    \item\textbf{It reduces stress:}The best and most important reason that gaming can be beneficial to players is that it gives employees a healthy way to relieve stress. During the game, you will be in different scenes that will help reduce your stress. Another thing is that you will not have more free time to turn to drugs.
\end{itemize}

 \section{Disadvantage of mobile games}%\I have explained the disadvantages of mobile games in a list here.
every thing has its benefits and damage until you got information about the advantage of mobile games it is time to review the disadvantage of mobile games.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weakness in vision:} More attention and thinking is required during to play game, this makes the player not blink at all in a minute, this itself is considered a negative effect, it causes poor eyesight.
    \item\textbf{Increasing the probability of disease:} Continuous use of mobile phones causes the emergence of various diseases in humans over time. In this sense, be cautious in using mobile games. Every electronic device emits radiation that cannot be seen.
    \item\textbf{Reduction of social relations:} The more people have contact with the outside environment, the more social relationships they have. People who play alone have weak social relationships.
Mobile games are mostly played alone, so it keeps people isolated and away from society.
Being isolated and reducing the level of communication is one of the disadvantages of playing mobile games for people, which should be taken seriously. Because this issue may affect his future.
